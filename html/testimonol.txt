I had no sales experience.

The training had me up to speed quickly.  I'm making more money than my full-time job.  I work only 5 hours a week. One of the best choices I have ever made.

Coming from 5 years of sales experience

Go up to speed really fast.  The classes were easy to understand.  But what got me the most was the pay.  For the amount of work that you have to put in.  The pay is awesome   

All I can say is $$$

I just was able to cover my rent in one week of working.  Need I say more.
